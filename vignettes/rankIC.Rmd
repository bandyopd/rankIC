## Introduction

`rankIC` is the R package to fit the linear rank regressions when the data are partially interval-censored and possibly correlated within same cluster
Let $T$ and $X$ be the event time of interest and its related $p-$vector of covariates, respectively.
We are interested in fitting the semiparametric accelerated failure time model 
$$
\log T = \beta'X + \varepsilon,
$$
where $\beta$ where $\beta$ is a $p$-vector of unknown regression parameters and $\varepsilon$ is a random residual  variable with a common but unknown distribution.
When the data are subject to partially interval-censoring, 
left and right endpoints of the censoring time, $U$ and $V$,
are observed instead of $T$ such that $T\in(U,V)$.
Note that double-censoring  can also  be viewed as 
a special case of partly interval-censoring, 
i.e., $T$ is left-censored if $U=0$ and right-censored if $V=\infty$. 

More generally, we consider a clustered data, when subjects are sampled in clusters, such that the failure times within the same cluster
tend to be correlated. 
Suppose there are $n$ clusters, with the $i$th cluster 
having $m_i$ members $(m_i\ll n)$. 
For the $k$th member in the $i$th cluster,
let $(T_{ik},U_{ik},V_{ik})$ denote a tuple of 
the exact observation, left and right examination times, and 
$\Delta_{ik}=1-I(U_{ik}\le T_{ik}<V_{ik})$ 
the censoring indicator,
such that $\Delta_{ik}=1$ when $T_{ik}\not\in(U_{ik},V_{ik})$. 
We assume that the marginal distribution of $T_{ik}$ follows the AFT model
$$
\log T_{ik} = \beta' X_{ik} + \varepsilon_{ik},~
(i=1,\ldots,n; k=1,\ldots,m_i),
$$
where $(\varepsilon_{i1},\ldots,\varepsilon_{im_i}),~i=1,\ldots,n$ are independent random vectors.

Let 
$u_{ik}(\beta)=\log \tilde U_{ik}-\beta'X_{ik}$
and 
$v_{ik}(\beta)=\log \tilde V_{ik}-\beta'X_{ik}$
denote the observed residuals.
By generalizing the idea of Jin et al. (2003), we propose 
the weighted log-rank estimating equation to estimate $\beta$,
$$
\tilde S_\phi(\beta) = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i\sum_{k=1}^{m_i} \eta_{2ik}\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)
\left[ X_{ik} - \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} X_{jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}  }
{\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}}  \right],
$$
where $\eta_{1ik}=\Delta_{ik}+(1-\Delta_{ik})I(U_{ik}>0)$
and $\eta_{2ik}=\Delta_{ik}+(1-\Delta_{ik})I(V_{ik}<\infty)$,
and $\varphi_i$ is a known weight to adjust 
for possible informative cluster sizes. 
By convention, we may use $\varphi_i=1$, 
which tends to overweight the large clusters, because each individual contributes equally in the estimating equation.
Furthermore, this choice implies the univariate AFT model.
When cluster sizes are informative to the outcome of interest, 
we can incorporate the inverse of cluster sizes as a weight,
for example, $\varphi_i=1/m_i$ or $\varphi_i=1/m_i^{\alpha}$ 
for some $0<\alpha\le1$. This adjustment is also known to  increase statistical efficiency Wang and Zhao (2008).
Finally, $\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)$ is a weight function, 
leading to the Gehan estimator and the log-rank estimator, 
respectively, if $\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)=\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}$ and 
$\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)=1$. 

See Choi et al. (2022+) for more detailed description of our estimating procedures.

## Usages

Installation of `rankIC` package can be done by
```{r,eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo='taehwa015/rankIC')
```

`aft_rank()` function has the following arguments:
```{r,eval = FALSE}
aft_rank(U,V,X,Delta,id,alpha,type,maxit,tol,R)
```
see the detailed description from `help(aft_rank)`.

We first simulate univariate doubly-censored data
with normal random error, which is one of 
simulation set-ups in Choi et al. (2022+).
```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(rankIC)
set.seed(111)
n = 200
x1 = rnorm(n)
x2 = ifelse(rnorm(n)>0, 1, 0)
X = cbind(x1,x2)
T = 2 + x1 + x2 + rnorm(n)
U = (1 - 0.25*x1)*runif(n, -6, 3.85)
V = U + (1 - 0.5*x2)*runif(n, 6, 19.6)
U = exp(dplyr::case_when(TRUE ~ T, T>V ~ V, T<U ~ -Inf))
V = exp(dplyr::case_when(TRUE ~ T, T>V ~ Inf, T<U ~ U))
Delta = ifelse(U==V, 1, 0)
aft_rank(U = U, V = V, X = X, Delta = Delta, type = "gehan", R = 20)
aft_rank(U = U, V = V, X = X, Delta = Delta, type = "logrank", R = 20)
```
We posit two estimating methods, Gehan and log-rank,
which can be conducted by specifying `type = "gehan"` and `type = "logrank"`, respectively.



Next, we give illustrative example of the method for the multivariate clustered data, 
by using phase 3 metastatic colorectal cancer clinical trial.
This dataset is available `data(mCRC)` in `PICBayes` package (Pan, 2021).
```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(PICBayes)
data(mCRC)
dt0 = as.data.frame(mCRC)
d = with(dt0,
         data.frame(U = ifelse(is.na(L), 0, L),
                    V = ifelse(is.na(R), Inf, R),
                    Delta = 1-IC,
                    x1 = TRT_C,
                    x2 = KRAS_C,
                    id = SITE))
U = d$U; V = d$V; X = cbind(d$x1,d$x2); Delta = d$Delta; id = d$id
aft_rank(U = U, V = V, X = X, Delta = Delta, id = id, 
         alpha = 1, type = "gehan", R = 20)
aft_rank(U = U, V = V, X = X, Delta = Delta, id = id, 
         alpha = 1, type = "logrank", R = 20)
```
The treatment variable is positlvely related to the progression-free survival (PFS) time, while the mutant-type of KRAS status accelerates the PFS time.
For the stable variance estimation, it is recommended to increase the number of resampling (`R`), e.g., `R = 200`.
