## Introduction

`rankIC` is the R package to fit the linear rank regressions when the data are partially interval-censored and possibly correlated within same cluster
Let $T$ and $X$ be the event time of interest and its related $p-$vector of covariates, respectively.
We are interested in fitting the semiparametric accelerated failure time model 
$$
\log T = \beta'X + \varepsilon,
$$
where $\beta$ where $\beta$ is a $p$-vector of unknown regression parameters and $\varepsilon$ is a random residual  variable with a common but unknown distribution.

When the data are subject to partially interval-censoring, 
left and right endpoints of the censoring time, $U$ and $V$,
are observed instead of $T$ such that $T\in(U,V)$.
Note that double-censoring  can also  be viewed as 
a special case of partly interval-censoring, 
i.e., $T$ is left-censored if $U=0$ and right-censored if $V=\infty$. 
By generalizing the idea of Jin et al. (2003), we propose 
the weighted log-rank estimating equation to estimate $\beta$,
$$
\tilde S_\phi(\beta) = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i\sum_{k=1}^{m_i} \eta_{2ik}\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)
\left[ X_{ik} - \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} X_{jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}  }
{\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}}  \right],
$$
where $\eta_{1ik}=\Delta_{ik}+(1-\Delta_{ik})I(U_{ik}>0)$
and $\eta_{2ik}=\Delta_{ik}+(1-\Delta_{ik})I(V_{ik}<\infty)$,
and $\varphi_i$ is a known weight to adjust 
for possible informative cluster sizes. 
By convention, we may use $\varphi_i=1$, 
which tends to overweight the large clusters, because each individual contributes equally in the estimating equation.
When cluster sizes are informative to the outcome of interest, 
we can incorporate the inverse of cluster sizes as a weight,
for example, $\varphi_i=1/m_i$ or $\varphi_i=1/m_i^{\alpha}$ 
for some $0<\alpha\le1$. This adjustment is also known to  increase statistical efficiency Wang and Zhao (2008).
Finally, $\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)$ is a weight function, 
leading to the Gehan estimator and the log-rank estimator, 
respectively, if $\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)=\sum_{j=1}^n\varphi_j\sum_{l=1}^{m_j}\eta_{1jl} I\{v_{ik}(\beta)\le u_{jl}(\beta) \}$ and 
$\tilde\phi_{ik}(\beta)=1$. 

See Choi et al. (2022+) for more detailed description of estimating our methods.
